          Over the next two years, my goals focus on expanding my technical
          expertise, contributing to the community, and developing leadership
          skills. These goals are designed to make me a well-rounded
          professional capable of tackling diverse challenges in the tech
          industry. By achieving these goals, I aim to position myself at the
          forefront of technological innovation and make meaningful
          contributions to the field. I would list my goals and give a better
          explanation below.

          1. Become Proficient in Front-end Development
        </h2>

          <b> B</b>ecoming proficient in front-end development is a crucial step
          for anyone aiming to excel in the tech industry. I aim to master
          frontend technologies, focusing on HTML, CSS JavaScript and React.
          Front-end development is in high demand. As the digital world
          continues to expand, businesses across all sectors are increasingly
          investing in their online presence. This means a growing need for
          skilled front-end developers who can create engaging, user-friendly
          websites and applications. Proficiency in front-end development opens
          doors to numerous career opportunities, from working in tech startups
          to large corporations, and also freelance work. Front-end developers
          play a pivotal role in shaping the user experience (UX). They are
          responsible for creating the look and feel of a website or
          application, ensuring it is intuitive, responsive, and visually
          appealing. A well-designed user interface (UI) can significantly
          enhance user satisfaction and retention, which is critical for the
          success of any digital product. By mastering front-end development,
          you can directly impact how users interact with and perceive a
          product. A strong portfolio is essential for showcasing your skills
          and attracting potential employers or clients. Proficiency in
          front-end development allows you to create impressive, functional
          websites and applications that can demonstrate your capabilities. A
          well-rounded portfolio featuring various projects can significantly
          boost your credibility and marketability in the job market.

          <b> E</b>ngaging with the open-source community will help me improve
          my coding skills and collaborate with other developers. Working on
          open-source projects allows me to apply my skills in real-world
          scenarios. I would gain hands-on experience with actual codebases,
          which can be far more instructive than theoretical learning or
          small-scale personal projects. Moreover, based on problem solving, I
          encounter and solve various technical challenges, which enhances my
          problem-solving skills. This experience is invaluable as it mirrors
          the kind of issues I might face in professional development
          environments. Contributions to open-source projects serve as tangible
          proof of my skills and experience. They are excellent additions to my
          portfolio, showcasing my ability to work on real-world projects and
          collaborate with other developers.

          <b>I</b> plan to create and launch at least three personal projects to
          enhance my portfolio and practical experience. Deploying my own
          projects gives me hands-on experience with deployment processes and
          tools. I would learn how to set up servers, manage databases, and
          ensure your application is accessible to users. Seeing my project come
          to life and being used by others provides a great sense of
          accomplishment. This validation of my skills and efforts can be highly
          motivating and encourage me to take on more complex projects.

          <b>B</b>y learning cloud computing, I would gain a better
          understanding of how the back-end infrastructure operates. This
          knowledge helps me to collaborate more effectively with back-end
          developers, leading to smoother integrations and more cohesive project
          development. Cloud computing services often include CDNs, which would
          distribute my content across multiple servers globally. This ensures
          faster load times and better performance for my front-end
          applications, especially for users in different geographic zones and
          locations. Learning about serverless architecture enables me to deploy
          functions and services without managing servers. This simplifies the
          deployment process and reduces operational overhead, allowing me to
          focus more on the front-end aspects of my projects.
